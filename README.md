# <PreWork Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I created this project to help recall key components of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and to have my notes on one place. 
- I built this project to not only have something to refer back to throughout the course, but to see how far I've come by the end of these six months.   
- This project solves the problem of creating a study guide website for prework notes to help keep bootcamp students organized and on track.
- This assignment has helped familiarize me with navigating GitHub, Git Bash, as well as Chrome DevTools. It's also taught me to utilize the interent for any problem I came across throughout the process.
